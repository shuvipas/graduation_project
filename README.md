# graduation project 
This project focuses on designing a cost-effective tester prototype for NANOX's innovative X-ray imaging chips. The goal is to measure the DC resistance between the gate and cathode, ensuring chip efficiency. The system, controlled by an Arduino, utilizes a voltage-controlled current source for comprehensive chip validation.
For an in-depth exploration of this project, refer to the graduation book (included PDF file).
